          <h4>Bio</h4>
          <p>Thor Odinson, known as the God of Thunder, is a powerful Asgardian warrior and the son of Odin, the All-Father of Asgard. Armed with his enchanted hammer, Mjölnir, Thor can control thunder and lightning, granting him immense power and the ability to manipulate weather. Despite his godly abilities, Thor's journey to Earth teaches him humility and compassion, transforming him into a protector of Midgard (Earth) and a founding member of the Avengers. With superhuman strength, near-immortality, and unmatched combat skills, Thor stands as one of the mightiest heroes in the Marvel Universe.</p>
