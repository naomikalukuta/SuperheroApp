          <h4>Bio</h4>
          <p>Dr. Bruce Banner, a brilliant scientist, transforms into the Hulk, a massive green-skinned behemoth, after a gamma radiation experiment goes awry. The Hulk possesses extraordinary strength, stamina, and regenerative abilities, with his power increasing in proportion to his anger. While Banner constantly grapples with controlling the Hulk's rage and maintaining his humanity, the Hulk remains a formidable and essential member of the Avengers. Despite his inner turmoil, Hulk's strength and resilience make him an invaluable asset in the fight against evil.</p>
